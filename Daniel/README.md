project 0x16. C - Simple Shell ‚úèÔ∏è
üñãÔ∏è Description

The project is about creating our version of a command line interpreter: shell. Simple_shell is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input.
üìã Requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    Your shell should not have any memory leaks
    No more than 5 functions per file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    Use system calls only when you need to

‚öô Compilation

Your shell will be compiled this way: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
üß™ Testing

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$

But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
